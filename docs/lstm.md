# LSTM Text Generator

Text generation is one of the main features used in many AI-based tools. Smart speakers, home assistants, and voice assistants on our smartphones are a few examples that use text generation. LSTM is short for Long Short Term Memory. Since RNN canâ€™t hold sequential data for a long time and begins to forget the previous inputs when there are new inputs, LSTM is used. LSTM is designed with many different gates. This design solves the problem of short-term memory learning. This project shows a small example of LSTM text generation. It output 73 results/examples.
