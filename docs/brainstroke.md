# Brain Stroke Prediction

A brain stroke is a medical condition where there is a lack of blood flow to the brain which can cause cell death. There are two main types of stroke. One is called an ischemic stroke. This is caused when there is a lack of blood flow. Another stroke is called a hemorrhagic stroke. This is caused when there is bleeding. Both types of stroke cause parts of the brain to stop functioning properly. A stroke may exhibit some signs and symptoms which include the inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, dizziness, or loss of vision to one side. There are many risk factors that can cause a stroke. Some of these are high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, tobacco smoking, obesity, diabetes mellitus, a previous TIA, end-stage kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. This model will use some of these risk factors, and other factors, to predict if a stroke will happen to a person or not.
