# US Retail Sales

Over the years sales have risen linearly. However, there are three times when it didnâ€™t rise like usual. In 2008, 2020, and 2021. In 2008, there was a recession because of a housing crisis and it caused a dip in sales. In 2020, Covid-19 caused a dip in sales. In 2021, the vaccine rollout and inflation rates caused a spike in sales.
