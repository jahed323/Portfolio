# About Me

In 2020, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from New Jersey Institute of Technology. After learning about SQL and RDBMS during on the job training, I became fascinated about working with data. I then found myself enrolled to get a Master of Science in Data Science from Bellevue University. My fascination grew through projects and the many things I learned about data science.
