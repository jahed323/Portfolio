# Loan dataset modeling

The loan dataset modeling project builds and compares three different models that predict if an applicant is elegible for a loan or not. The dataset being modeled has many features that effect if an applicant is allowed to get a loan. Some features include their income, loan amount, credit history, and amount of dependents. The first model created was a pipeline with a min-max scaler and a KNN classifier. The second model added a search space to the KNN classifier. The third model expanded the search space to include logistic regression and random forest models.
