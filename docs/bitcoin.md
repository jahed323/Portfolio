# Bitcoin Price Prediction

I observed the relationships between mortgage interest rates, cryptocurrency prices, and Covid-19 rates to try and predict if the price of Bitcoin would increase or decrease on a certain day. From 2020 to 2021, we noticed some big differences in the mortgage interest rates and cryptocurrency prices. It was observed that mortgage interest rates were lower. In addition, cryptocurrency prices were at an all-time high. It seems like the pandemic had some sort of effect on the mortgage interest rates and cryptocurrency prices. The reason for finding the relationship between the three to try and predict if the price of Bitcoin would increase or decrease on a certain day is important is because it will help many people and organizations to invest in cryptocurrencies more confidently. If a pandemic similar to Covid-19 happens again, these investors will be more prepared and confident when investing in cryptocurrencies.
