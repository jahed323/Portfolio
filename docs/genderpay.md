# EDA Gender Pay Gap

This EDA was done to find out if other variables impact income more than gender. The data set that was used was a decent size. Only six out of the nine variables were used in this analysis. Their variables are Gender, Age, Education, Dept, Seniority, and BasePay. The hypothesis being tested was if the variable BasePay had some sort of relationship with any of the other variables. The results of the analysis showed a relationship between BasePay and Age. In addition, the regression analysis showed a potential relationship between BasePay and Seniority as well.
