El Salvador’s effect on Bitcoin

After El Salvador listed Bitcoin as a legal tender, it confused many people. The question for this topic that I will be solving is, “How will Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies react now that Bitcoin is a national currency in El Salvador?” A criterion I will research is the past price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and future prices that will be seen in the coming weeks. Another criterion I will investigate is how some of the citizens are reacting to this law.
